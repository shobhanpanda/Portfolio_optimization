# Portfolio_optimization
In this project, we have taken 1-year stock data of 2 stocks namely Apple and Pfizer from 2017 to 2018. Using the efficient frontier, we calculate the weights to maximize Sharpe ratio of the portfolio containing the 2 assets. After that we simulate the stock prices using the following 4 models: Geometric Brownian Motion, Merton, Heston and CEV. 
For each model we calculated new weights for the assets using the simulated prices to maximize Sharpe ratio. 
Then we check if we can increase the Sharpe ratio even further by using ATM call options. At the end we compare the Sharpe ratio across models and see which model performs best.
